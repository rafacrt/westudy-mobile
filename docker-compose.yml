      # NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: http://api.example.com
      # DATABASE_URL: postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
      # These would override any defaults or be necessary if your app expects them
      # For NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY, ensure it's available if needed at runtime
      # or built into the image if it's a NEXT_PUBLIC_ variable and used during build.
      # However, for keys, it's better to pass them at runtime.
      NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: "${NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY}" # Example: Get from .env file for local compose
    # If you have a local .env file for docker-compose to read, uncomment next line
    # env_file:
    #  - .env # This .env file is for docker-compose, not to be confused with .env.local for next dev

    volumes:
      # If you have specific data that needs to persist outside the container, define volumes here.
      # For a typical Next.js app, usually, no volumes are needed for the app code itself post-build.
      # Example for persistent logs or uploaded files if not using external storage:
      # - ./persistent_data/uploads:/app/public/uploads
      pass: # This line will be removed
